# Project 3: Around The U.S.

[Link to the project](https://tj-singh-portfolio.github.io/se_project_aroundtheus/index.html)

## Overview

In this project, I created a website with responsive design that works at a few common resolutions (320px, 800px, and 1280px). The resolutions between these breakpoints should still display the website fairly well. I used HTML and CSS to code it. CSS grid, media queries, flexbox, and relative units are the main tools I used to make this design work.

## Demo Images

### Plans for Improvement

I plan on making the intermediate resolutions between the common ones more aesthetically pleasing.
